# Establish goals

# Play 1: Clearly define and communicate your objectives

Federal agencies understand the importance of meaningful public engagement. The type of engagement will differ for each organization, depending on resources, audience and mission. Every agency must set goals that align with its unique definition of success and empowers the public to engage with agencies in order to influence government priorities.

**Checklist**

- Identify what goal(s) you aim to achieve.
- Develop a plan that includes a timeline, and strategy – ramp up and drawdown.
- Evaluate organizational capacity for engaging and managing public participation.
- Identify internal and external stakeholders and partners.
- Evaluate and change strategy based on feedback and performance data.

**Case Studies**

- ePolicyWorks is an initiative by the Department of Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy. The tool is designed around a clear policy-making objective and addresses specific challenges in collaborative policy making.
- The National Archives process for developing regulations uses theRegulations.gov portal during the commenting period to consider public input and make relevant, appropriate revisions. Regulations.gov is a portal that simplifies finding, reviewing, and submitting comments on Rules and Proposed Rules that appear in the Federal Register.

**Resources**

- The Environmental Protection Agency Public Participation Guide contains numerous resources, including an excellent discussion of situation assessments.
- Synthesis 89, by Scott Giering, discusses The Transit Cooperative Research Program's efforts to coordinate effective public participation strategies for transit, e.g. goal-setting, information exchange, and identifying "the public."
- The Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration provides aTransportation Professional Capacity Building site with many resources andcase studies.

**Metrics: How Do You Know You Successfully Established Goals?**

Metrics will vary according to the platform you use. Some broad examples include:

- Surveys – responses should drive learning and improvement.
- Web – Google Analytics or heat-mapping shows participant engagement.
- Email – click rates, bounce rates, unsubscribes, participation in a call-to-action.
- Social Media – participant engagement analytics, reach, changing behavior, hashtag use.
- Apps (native and mobile) – use statistics, are "transactions" being completed, is there input or feedback from the field (i.e., uploading multiple photos in citizen science app), are people actively using a native app (i.e., logging in multiple times).
- Online Video Chats (i.e., hangouts) – participation rate, views.
- Discussion Threads (i.e., chat rooms) – number of participants, input from the public, up votes / down votes.
- Blog – viewership, comments, action audience takes next.
- Transactional – hard numbers related to online transaction completion.
- Rates of completion for public participation opportunities (e.g., Comment form submissions to federal agencies)
- Rates of API participation and usage, e.g., number of API implementations, queries received via API, successful submissions received via API.

# Understand the Playing Field

# Play 2: Understand your participants and stakeholder groups

Community and stakeholder understanding is key to organizing a successful participatory effort. Once you determine who you're trying to reach, you can refine your outreach efforts to effectively communicate with participants and stakeholders.

**Checklist**

- Create personas of your target participants in order to understand their needs.
- Conduct sampling and initial outreach to better define and understand participants.
- Use groupwork methods to draw representations based on observation and not assumption.

- Determine how you will reach diverse groups of people with broad perspectives.
- Identify gatekeepers, including community groups, who can help reach potential participants.
- Customize your engagement strategies for each type of stakeholder.
- Meet your audience where they are, not where you want them to be.

**Case Studies**

It provides tips for analyzing and segmenting an audience, choosing appropriate channels and tools, and evaluating the success of messages or campaigns.

# Play 3: Understand and communicate the benefit of participation

Participants must understand how they can contribute to a program and why it is important they participate. Clearly defined and communicated benefits help craft effective messages and inclusive engagement. Understanding what successful participation looks like is critical to knowing whether your program succeeds.

**Checklist**

- Decide what essential information participants need to know before engagement.
- Build a communications strategy that considers the expectations and motivations of participants and the value of participation.

- Give a Minute is a micro-participation/crowdsourcing event with clear expectations for participants. Moderators collect and share ideas both digitally and in-person.
- NASA Socials are events where NASA's social media followers can learn about NASA's missions, people, and programs. Through these behind-the-scenes experiences, participants are empowered to advocate for the agency and attend future events.

# Play 4: Empower participants through public/private partnership

Leveraging corporate and community partners is a powerful way of gaining support and participation for government campaigns and events. Partners and sponsors can help reach new audiences or reinforce messages within existing ones. Public/private partnerships also legitimize both what your agency is trying to accomplish and how that information or program is delivered.

**Checklist**

- Define and create partnerships.
- Survey agency employees for knowledge of community and stakeholder groups.
- Reach out to nonprofit organizations and community partners who can amplify participation opportunities and connect your agency with additional partners.
